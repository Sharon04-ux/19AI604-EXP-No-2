<H1 ALIGN =CENTER> Creating and Running a Rust Project with Cargo Tool </H1>  

## AIM:  
To create and run a Rust project using the Cargo build system and package manager.  

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:  
- Hardware – PCs  
- Rust Installation  
- Cargo Toolchain  

## RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPT:  

*Rust:*  
Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but it guarantees memory safety without needing a garbage collector.  

*Cargo:*  
Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. It helps manage dependencies, compile packages, and make distributions. It is the tool most commonly used for Rust projects and comes pre-installed with Rust.  

*Need for Cargo:*  
- Simplifies project creation and management.  
- Handles external dependencies easily.  
- Provides an easy way to build, run, and test Rust programs.  
- Helps ensure reproducibility across environments.  

## ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Install Rust and Cargo on the system. <BR>  
STEP 2: Create a new project using Cargo. <BR>  
STEP 3: Navigate to the project directory. <BR>  
STEP 4: Build the project using Cargo build. <BR>  
STEP 5: Run the project using Cargo run. <BR>  
STEP 6: Verify the output in the terminal. <BR>  

## PROGRAM:  
```

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust with Cargo!");
}
```

## RESULT:
Thus we have successfully created and Executed a rust project with cargo
